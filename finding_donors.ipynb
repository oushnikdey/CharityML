    "## Getting Started\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project, you will employ several supervised algorithms of your choice to accurately model individuals' income using data collected from the 1994 U.S. Census. You will then choose the best candidate algorithm from preliminary results and further optimize this algorithm to best model the data. Your goal with this implementation is to construct a model that accurately predicts whether an individual makes more than $50,000. This sort of task can arise in a non-profit setting, where organizations survive on donations.  Understanding an individual's income can help a non-profit better understand how large of a donation to request, or whether or not they should reach out to begin with.  While it can be difficult to determine an individual's general income bracket directly from public sources, we can (as we will see) infer this value from other publically available features. \n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset for this project originates from the [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Census+Income). The datset was donated by Ron Kohavi and Barry Becker, after being published in the article _\"Scaling Up the Accuracy of Naive-Bayes Classifiers: A Decision-Tree Hybrid\"_. You can find the article by Ron Kohavi [online](https://www.aaai.org/Papers/KDD/1996/KDD96-033.pdf). The data we investigate here consists of small changes to the original dataset, such as removing the `'fnlwgt'` feature and records with missing or ill-formatted entries."

    "## Preparing the Data\n",
    "Before data can be used as input for machine learning algorithms, it often must be cleaned, formatted, and restructured — this is typically known as **preprocessing**. Fortunately, for this dataset, there are no invalid or missing entries we must deal with, however, there are some qualities about certain features that must be adjusted. This preprocessing can help tremendously with the outcome and predictive power of nearly all learning algorithms."

    "### Transforming Skewed Continuous Features\n",
    "A dataset may sometimes contain at least one feature whose values tend to lie near a single number, but will also have a non-trivial number of vastly larger or smaller values than that single number.  Algorithms can be sensitive to such distributions of values and can underperform if the range is not properly normalized. With the census dataset two features fit this description: '`capital-gain'` and `'capital-loss'`. \n",

    "For highly-skewed feature distributions such as `'capital-gain'` and `'capital-loss'`, it is common practice to apply a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_transformation_(statistics)\">logarithmic transformation</a> on the data so that the very large and very small values do not negatively affect the performance of a learning algorithm. Using a logarithmic transformation significantly reduces the range of values caused by outliers. Care must be taken when applying this transformation however: The logarithm of `0` is undefined, so we must translate the values by a small amount above `0` to apply the the logarithm successfully.\n",

    "### Normalizing Numerical Features\n",
    "In addition to performing transformations on features that are highly skewed, it is often good practice to perform some type of scaling on numerical features. Applying a scaling to the data does not change the shape of each feature's distribution (such as `'capital-gain'` or `'capital-loss'` above); however, normalization ensures that each feature is treated equally when applying supervised learners. Note that once scaling is applied, observing the data in its raw form will no longer have the same original meaning, as exampled below.\n",
    "\n",
    "Run the code cell below to normalize each numerical feature. We will use [`sklearn.preprocessing.MinMaxScaler`](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.preprocessing.MinMaxScaler.html) for this."

    "\n",
    "From the table in **Exploring the Data** above, we can see there are several features for each record that are non-numeric. Typically, learning algorithms expect input to be numeric, which requires that non-numeric features (called *categorical variables*) be converted. One popular way to convert categorical variables is by using the **one-hot encoding** scheme. One-hot encoding creates a _\"dummy\"_ variable for each possible category of each non-numeric feature. For example, assume `someFeature` has three possible entries: `A`, `B`, or `C`. We then encode this feature into `someFeature_A`, `someFeature_B` and `someFeature_C`.\n",

    "| 1 |  C  | ----> one-hot encode ----> | 0 | 0 | 1 |\n",
    "| 2 |  A  |  | 1 | 0 | 0 |\n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, as with the non-numeric features, we need to convert the non-numeric target label, `'income'` to numerical values for the learning algorithm to work. Since there are only two possible categories for this label (\"<=50K\" and \">50K\"), we can avoid using one-hot encoding and simply encode these two categories as `0` and `1`, respectively. In code cell below, you will need to implement the following:\n",
    " - Use [`pandas.get_dummies()`](http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/generated/pandas.get_dummies.html?highlight=get_dummies#pandas.get_dummies) to perform one-hot encoding on the `'features_log_minmax_transform'` data.\n",
    " - Convert the target label `'income_raw'` to numerical entries.\n",

    "### Metrics and the Naive Predictor\n",
    "*CharityML*, equipped with their research, knows individuals that make more than \\$50,000 are most likely to donate to their charity. Because of this, *CharityML* is particularly interested in predicting who makes more than \\$50,000 accurately. It would seem that using **accuracy** as a metric for evaluating a particular model's performace would be appropriate. Additionally, identifying someone that *does not* make more than \\$50,000 as someone who does would be detrimental to *CharityML*, since they are looking to find individuals willing to donate. Therefore, a model's ability to precisely predict those that make more than \\$50,000 is *more important* than the model's ability to **recall** those individuals. We can use **F-beta score** as a metric that considers both precision and recall:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ F_{\\beta} = (1 + \\beta^2) \\cdot \\frac{precision \\cdot recall}{\\left( \\beta^2 \\cdot precision \\right) + recall} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "In particular, when $\\beta = 0.5$, more emphasis is placed on precision. This is called the **F$_{0.5}$ score** (or F-score for simplicity).\n",
    "\n",
    "Looking at the distribution of classes (those who make at most \\$50,000, and those who make more), it's clear most individuals do not make more than \\$50,000. This can greatly affect **accuracy**, since we could simply say *\"this person does not make more than \\$50,000\"* and generally be right, without ever looking at the data! Making such a statement would be called **naive**, since we have not considered any information to substantiate the claim. It is always important to consider the *naive prediction* for your data, to help establish a benchmark for whether a model is performing well. That been said, using that prediction would be pointless: If we predicted all people made less than \\$50,000, *CharityML* would identify no one as donors. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Note: Recap of accuracy, precision, recall\n",
    "\n",
    "** Accuracy ** measures how often the classifier makes the correct prediction. It’s the ratio of the number of correct predictions to the total number of predictions (the number of test data points).\n",
    "\n",
    "** Precision ** tells us what proportion of messages we classified as spam, actually were spam.\n",
    "It is a ratio of true positives(words classified as spam, and which are actually spam) to all positives(all words classified as spam, irrespective of whether that was the correct classificatio), in other words it is the ratio of\n",
    "\n",
    "`[True Positives/(True Positives + False Positives)]`\n",
    "\n",
    "** Recall(sensitivity)** tells us what proportion of messages that actually were spam were classified by us as spam.\n",
    "It is a ratio of true positives(words classified as spam, and which are actually spam) to all the words that were actually spam, in other words it is the ratio of\n",
    "\n",
    "`[True Positives/(True Positives + False Negatives)]`\n",
    "\n",
    "For classification problems that are skewed in their classification distributions like in our case, for example if we had a 100 text messages and only 2 were spam and the rest 98 weren't, accuracy by itself is not a very good metric. We could classify 90 messages as not spam(including the 2 that were spam but we classify them as not spam, hence they would be false negatives) and 10 as spam(all 10 false positives) and still get a reasonably good accuracy score. For such cases, precision and recall come in very handy. These two metrics can be combined to get the F1 score, which is weighted average(harmonic mean) of the precision and recall scores. This score can range from 0 to 1, with 1 being the best possible F1 score(we take the harmonic mean as we are dealing with ratios)."

Therefore our Accuracy in this case becomes the same as our Precision(True Positives/(True Positives + False Positives)) as every prediction that we have made with value '1' that should have '0' becomes a False Positive; therefore our denominator in this case is the total number of records we have in total. \n",

    "**Answer: **\n",
    "\n",
    "**1. SVM:** \n",
    "  * SVM is widely used in the industry to recognize handwritten characters. They are mainly used for data entry and       validating signatures on documents.\n",
    "  \n",
    "  * Advantages:\n",
    "      * SVM is an effective tool in the high dimensionality space. For example, handwriting recognition, where the           dimensionality can be extremely high.\n",
    "      * Class separation is often highly non-linear. The ability to apply new kernels allows substantial flexibility         for the decision boundaries, leading to greater classification performance.\n",
    "      * Uses a subset of training points in the decision function (called support vectors), so it is also memory             efficient.\n",
    "      \n",
    "  * Disadvantages:\n",
    "      * SVMs do not directly provide probability estimates, these are calculated using an expensive five-fold cross-         validation.\n",
    "      * Training time can be higer for a large dataset.\n",
    "      \n",
    "  * In our problem there are a number of features(high dimension) which could directly affect the income of a person.     Hence, SVM could be a good candidate for solving our problem. However, we have a huge dataset which could lead to     high training time depending on the hardware configurations.\n",

    "  \n",
    "**2. Decision Tree Classifier:**\n",
    "  * Decision Tree can be used in Fraud Detection Management, especially in financial statements or business               transactions so as to reduce the risk of loss.\n",
    "  \n",
    "  * Advantages:\n",
    "      * Decision Tree Classifier can be applied for both Numerical and Categorical independent variables.\n",
    "      * It can provide a visual output of the model.\n",
    "      * These models are fast.\n",
    "      * The results can be clearly interpreted. The outcome is transparent. \n",
    "      \n",
    "  * Disadvantages:\n",
    "      * Decision Tree Classifier has high variance. So, any change in the data will alter the results.\n",
    "      * It is prone to overfitting.\n",
    "      \n",
    "  * Decision Tree Classifier can be good for our model as they are good at making at deccisions for binary               classifications. However, we have a large number of features in our dataset. Hence, feature selection should be       taken care of for using this classifier.\n",

    "  https://www.quora.com/What-are-the-advantages-of-using-a-decision-tree-for-classification\n",
    "\n",
    "**AdaBoost Classifier:**\n",
    "  * AdaBoost can be used in Face Detection Systems to identify faces in images and video sequences. It can be used       for face recognition or face identification where an input image is compared against a database and reports a         match, if any. It can also be used in facial feature detection to detect the presence and location of                 features, such as eyes, nose, nostrils, eyebrows, mouth, lips, ears, etc., with the assumption that there is only     one face in an image.\n",
    "  * Advantages:\n",
    "      * It is fast, simple and easy to program.\n",
    "      * It requires no prior knowledge about the weak learner and so can be flexibly combined with any method for             finding weak hypotheses.\n",
    "  * Disadvantages:\n",
    "      * AdaBoost is vulnerable to the presence of noise in data. If there are outliers in the data, the weak learners         misclassify them and then try harder to correctly classify these outliers. This can lead to overfitting.\n",
    "      * If the weak classifiers are too complex it could lead to overfitting.\n",
    "      * If the weak classifiers are too weak then our model could be overfitted because of the presence of low               margins.\n",
    "  * We have have already seen that our dataset is quite clean and do not have many outliers. So, we do not have the       risk of overfitting due to outliers if we use AdaBoost. Also, we have a classification problem at hand whether we     are trying to find out if an individual earns more than 50K or not. So, I feel AdaBoost could provide valuable       predictions from the problem we have at hand.\n",

    "Based on the results obtained in the previous section, AdaBoost classifier should provide the best results to identify if an invidual's income is more than 50K or not. When using 100% of the trianing data we see that Decision Tree Classifier has very high accuracy score and F-score on the training data. However, these scores are lower than the other two classifiers when the model is used to make predictions for the testing dataset. Hence, we can conclude that Decision Tree Classifier tends to overfit on the training dataset. AdaBoost Classifier and SVC have almost the same accuracy score and F-score on the training dataset. But on the testing dataset the scores are higher for AdaBoost Classifier. Also, we see that the training and prediction time for AdaBoost classifier is quite low. It is much faster than the SVC classifier. Hence, if we take into account the accuracy score and Fscore along with the training/prediction time then AdaBoost classifier would be the best choice for us to make the predictions for the problem we have at hand.\n"

    "AdaBoost is the most commnly used boosting ensemble method for classification problems in the Machine Learning world. \n",
    "It is a tree based model. It works by combining multiple individual weak learners to create a strong model which is good at making predictions. Each weak learner is good at making predictions on the subset of data it works with. Hence, when all these weak learners are combined they are good at making predictions or classifications on the unknown data which these weak learners have never seen before. Below is the step by step explanation of how AdaBoost internally works:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Step 1:** Select a random subset of data and train a weak learner on this data. Now the weight of the misclassified             points in this step are increased so that the next weak learner will try to classify these point                     correctly. In other words the importance of these misclassified points are boosted.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Step 2:** The next weak learner will then try to correctly classify most of the misclassified points from the                   previous step.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Step 3:** Iterate the previous two steps *n* times.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Step 4:** Combine all the weak learners from the previous steps to create the stronger model. This stronger model               will then be used to classify the unknown data.\n",
    "\n",
    "When we apply this model on our dataset, each of the weak learners will take into account a subset of features(for e.g, age, race, sex, capital-loss, e.t.c) and try to predict the income of the person. Then all the misclassified points will be taken and their weights will be increased so that in next iteration these points would be given more importance(model will try to classify those points correctly). We need to decide how many such iterations do we need to make. At the end the result of these weak learners"

The graph above clearly shows that these 3 features are the most important ones. I had considered that **occupation** and **workclass** to be the other two important features.

    "How does a model perform if we only use a subset of all the available features in the data? With less features required to train, the expectation is that training and prediction time is much lower — at the cost of performance metrics. From the visualization above, we see that the top five most important features contribute more than half of the importance of **all** features present in the data. This hints that we can attempt to *reduce the feature space* and simplify the information required for the model to learn. The code cell below will use the same optimized model you found earlier, and train it on the same training set *with only the top five important features*. "
